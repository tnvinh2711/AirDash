# Privacy Policy for Flux

**Last updated: January 31, 2026**

## Introduction

Flux ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data We DO NOT Collect

Flux is designed with privacy as a core principle. We want to be clear about what we **DO NOT** do:

- ❌ We do NOT collect any personal information
- ❌ We do NOT track your usage or behavior
- ❌ We do NOT store your files on our servers
- ❌ We do NOT require account registration
- ❌ We do NOT use analytics or tracking services
- ❌ We do NOT share any data with third parties
- ❌ We do NOT display advertisements

### How Flux Works

Flux is a **peer-to-peer file transfer application** that works entirely on your local network:

1. **Local Network Only**: All file transfers happen directly between devices on your local WiFi network
2. **No Cloud Storage**: Files are transferred directly from device to device without passing through any servers
3. **No Internet Required**: The app works completely offline on your local network
4. **Temporary Connections**: Device discovery and file transfers are temporary and exist only during active sessions

### Permissions Required

Flux requires the following permissions to function:

- **Internet Access**: Required for local network communication between devices
- **WiFi State Access**: Required to detect and connect to devices on your local network
- **Storage Access**: Required to read files you want to send and save files you receive
- **Network Discovery**: Required to find other Flux devices on your local network

These permissions are used **only** for the core functionality of transferring files between devices on your local network.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

- Files you receive are saved to your device's local storage (typically the Downloads folder)
- Transfer history is stored locally on your device using SQLite database
- Device settings and preferences are stored locally on your device
- No data is ever transmitted to external servers or cloud services

### Data Retention

- Transfer history is stored on your device until you manually delete it
- You can clear all transfer history at any time from the app settings
- Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data

## Security

### Secure Transfers

- All file transfers happen over your local WiFi network
- Transfers use HTTP protocol for maximum compatibility
- Files are transferred directly between devices without intermediaries
- Only devices on the same local network can discover and connect to each other

### Your Responsibility

Since Flux operates on your local network, security depends on your network configuration:

- Use a secure WiFi network with strong password
- Only use Flux on trusted networks
- Be cautious when transferring sensitive files on public WiFi networks

## Third-Party Services

Flux does **NOT** use any third-party services, including:

- No analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics)
- No crash reporting services
- No advertising networks
- No cloud storage services
- No authentication services

## Children's Privacy

Flux does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app can be safely used by users of all ages.
